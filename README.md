# QueenB - Bootcamp Unity Effects Lecture Repo üí•

This repository was created for a lecture on adding effects to your Unity game. The project contains two main scenes:

1. **StartScene**: This scene provides the initial environment and basic setup for your Unity game. It includes the car functionality but lacks any special effects.

2. **FinishedScene**: In this scene, you'll find the complete setup that was demonstrated at the end of the lecture. It incorporates several effects to enhance your game:

   - **Trail Renderer**: Visualize object movement with trail effects.
   - **Particle Effects**: Add dynamic particle systems to your game.
   - **VFX Graph Effects**: Utilize Unity's Visual Effects Graph for stunning visuals.
   - **Post-processing**: Apply post-processing effects to enhance the overall look.
   - **Cinemachine Extensions**: Enhance camera control and cinematic sequences.
